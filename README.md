# week-2-AI-Based-Crop-Disease-Prediction
This project leverages the PlantVillage Dataset (Resized 224×224) to develop an AI-driven system for monitoring crop health. The dataset contains thousands of leaf images categorized as healthy or diseased, making it ideal for training and testing deep learning models in plant disease recognition.
